This is a home directory of the `motion` user I suggest you to create
to run the necessary processes with the least amount of privileges.

See instructions in the `etc` directory in this repo for creation steps.

`capture` dir is used to store the captured video frames with motion,
this is preconfigured in the example `motion.conf` I provide.

`scripts` dir contains all the custom scripts used with Motion as well as
Node.js modules.
